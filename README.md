Examples and stuff for the Labweek at HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd

---

## Using the examples

To make the examples working you need to create the file 'base-url.js' in the folder of the example you want to run. This js file just consists of this line:

``` javascript
const baseURL="https://some.server.url"   
```

Replace some.server.url with your server!
